    <h2> About Me:</h2>
    <p>
        Hello everybody! I am Hime and I love drinking milk tea. I made this website
        so that you peeps can fund my addiction. Hopefully my dedication to milk tea will
        encourage you to donate to my milk tea fundings. Any milk tea bought using the funds
        will be posted in this website! 
    </p>
    <h2> Why Should You Fund?</h2>
    <p>
        Have you ever wondered when you will ever meet the love of your life?
        Every bus ride, listening to emo songs,looking out of the window,
        thinking about when your other half will appear.
        Or thinking about the good times you had with your other half last time?
        Just like you, I think about milk tea all the time every day without fail.
        Thinking about the countless flavours I can get. Caramel milk tea? Black tea latte?
        teh peng? are just some of my favourites 
        But sadly, I am poor as everything has already been dedicated to my milk tea
        addiction.  
    </p>
    <p1>

        I hope that my touching story has give you the reason on why you should fund my milk tea!
        It is very simple and I appreciate every milk tea I drink. :>
